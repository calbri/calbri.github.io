        <p>Hi, I'm a fourth year Software Engineering/Mathematics student at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.</p>

        <p>I build programs, apps and websites using Python, Javascript and Java. I also have experience with React Native,
            compilers and databases. I'm currently working on my thesis - a deep learning based method of removing make-up
            from portraits, extending research from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10151.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7299093/">here</a>.</p>
