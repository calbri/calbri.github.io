            <p>Hi, I'm a fourth year Software Engineering/Mathematics student at the University of Queensland, Brisbane,
                Australia.
            </p>

            <p>I build programs, apps and websites using Python, Javascript and Java. I also have experience with React Native,
                compilers and databases. I'm currently working on my thesis - a deep learning based method of removing make-up
                from portraits, extending research from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10151.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7299093/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Check out some of my projects at my <a href="http://github.com/calbri">GitHub</a>.</p>

                        <p>CC was an app developed by University of Queensland and Dalian Neusoft University of Information
                            students working as part of the New Colombo Scholarship. Designed to combat growing amounts of
                            pollution in major cities, it provides incentives for users to use public transport through "gamification"
                            - competing with friends to save the most amount of CO2 while earning rewards and vouchers for
                            their favourite stores along the way.</p>


                        <p>My role was in Android development, working on the interface and program flow within the app,
                            following Material Design guidelines and providing a robust, data-driven interface.</p>
